# TechCorp Analysis Using SQL

## Project Overview
This project analyzes operational data from TechCorp, an e-commerce company specializing in electronic devices such as laptops, smartphones, and accessories, while also providing technical support services.

## Objectives
- Analyze customer purchasing behavior and value
- Evaluate product performance and pricing strategy
- Assess employee productivity and revenue metrics 

## Tools
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)

## Analysis Approach
- Database & Table Structure Design 
Created the TechCorp database from scratch, designed six core tables (products, customers, orders, order_details, employees, support_tickets), and established relational integrity through foreign key constraints.
- Data Preparation & Cleaning
Inserted data into tables, created additional columns, ensured proper data types, and checked data consistency.
- Analytical Querying
Executed queries to identify top customers, unsold products, revenue totals, employee performance, pricing trends, etc.

## Conclusion

- A small number of customers, especially John Doe, contribute a significant portion of total revenue, showing strong revenue concentration.
- Premium product categories (Laptops and Smartphones) dominate high-value transactions, indicating where most revenue potential lies.
- Customer purchasing behavior is highly uneven, with clear gaps between high-value and low-value customers.
- Operational performance varies across employees, with Alice Williams standing out as a high-impact support contributor.

## Recommendations

- Prioritize high-value customers through VIP programs, personalized offers, or dedicated support to protect key revenue sources.
- Focus sales and marketing efforts on premium categories by strengthening upselling and cross-selling strategies.
- Use targeted campaigns to increase average order value among mid-tier customers.
- Optimize operations by rewarding top-performing employees and reviewing underperforming products like Wireless Earphones for improvement or removal.
